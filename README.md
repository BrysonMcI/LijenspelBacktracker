Aditional Details:
	Only supports basic grid puzzles 9x9 and below
  Only support single digit numbers
  Missing a way to keep track of old previously reached configurations (This is a limitation
    currently due to the fact that I go one arrow at a time).
  A 9x9 puzzle considered hard took over 180 minutes on my i7 4770. Obviously this needs to be improved.
